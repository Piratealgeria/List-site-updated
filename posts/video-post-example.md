# Embedding Videos in Blog Posts

This is an example post showing how to embed videos in your blog posts.

## YouTube Videos

You can simply drop a YouTube URL into your markdown:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Or you can use our special video embed feature by adding a `videoUrl` field to your post's frontmatter.

## Why Use Video in Blog Posts?

Videos can:

1. Increase engagement
2. Explain complex topics visually
3. Provide a more dynamic user experience

Try adding videos to your next blog post!
